# OSSP-SKKU_2048

------

## Project Plan Reason
>Hello, we are OS_Team18. Recently, at a time when the importance of IP utilization is drawing attention, such as Pokemon Bread, we tried to use Sungkyunkwan University's IP to promote the school and carry out a project that can contain the fun of the game.
>After discussion, we were sure that if we applied Sungkyunkwan University IP to a simple game called "2048", which was popular in the past, we could make a familar web game. We tried to create "Yuljeon and Myeongryun's Travel Story" by drawing out the charm of 2048 as much as possible.
